JustSit is designed to help you meditate. It currently runs timers for preparation to meditate and meditation, and allows you to turn off audible ringing and/or the device radios, and keep the screen on while the timer is running.

The name is inspired by the saying,

"If you walk, just walk, if you sit, just sit, but whatever you do, don't wobble."
-Zen Master Unmon
